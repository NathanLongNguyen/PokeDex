## What is it and why?

As of right now, this is a search engine for pokemon using the React.JS. The feature right now is fairly basic as I am still new to web development and am doing this on my free time. I choose to do a project with pokemon because it is something I love and connected to as a kid. 

### How to use it?

Type in the a pokemon's ID # or name and just press the button!

### Plans?

Right now I am working on displaying an evolution chain that correspond to the selected pokemon. The styling of the site will look similar to that of the original pokedex.
